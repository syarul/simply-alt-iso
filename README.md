# simply-alt-iso
A working copy of [coodoo](https://github.com/coodoo/react-alt-isomorphic-example) sample alt though with slight modification. I simplify the API call by removing the Utility method. The sample page use a firebase api and a simple counter. It seems by not having react-router there's less headache in figuring the routing and much more opaque, you can shape the routing in anyway you like.
